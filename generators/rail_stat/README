Supported Environments, like Flash, Java etc.
Screen Resolution.

== Installation Instructions ==

It is assumed that you have already generated your rails app.
These steps apply for either a new or existing app.

Step One: Install the Plugin
-----------------------------
1. Install the rail_stat plugin from github using the following command:

script/plugin install git://github.com/nerbie69/railstat.git

Step Two: Generate rail_stat
----------------------------
1. After installing the plugin, run the following command:

script/generate rail_stat

2. Notice that your app has now been populated with the generated rail_stat code, such as views/rail_stat, model/rail_stat.rb etc...

Step Three: Database Migration
------------------------------

1. Create the database schema using rake db:migrate

2. Download the IP-to-Country database from http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/ :

   wget http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/downloads/ip-to-country.csv.zip
   unzip ip-to-country.csv.zip
For MAC OS/X Users: instead of getting wget onto your system, just download the file using Safari.

3. Copy ip-to-country.csv into db/ directory

4. Upload the data using ip-to-country.mysql.sql:

   mysql -u _user_ _dbname_ < ip-to-country.mysql.sql

5. Add your web site name to the end of config/environment.rb (assign it to a constant SITE_NAME)
   
   Example:
   SITE_NAME = 'www.mydomain.com'

Notes: Steps 2 - 4 are optional. If you don't want to download ip-to-country database 
       the system will work but the visitor country will not be tracked.

== Upcoming Features ==
Access control to secure rail_stat for admin only viewing.
