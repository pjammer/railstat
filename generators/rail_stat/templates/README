Rail_Stat - Website stat tracking from within your rails app!

Updated to work with Rails 2.2.2, this plugin allows you to view stats about your website from within your app.

Features include:
Hits - Today and last 7 days
OS platform and Browser
Languages
Country identifiers
Referrers
Supported Environments, like Flash, Java etc.
Screen Resolution.

== Installation Instructions ==

It is assumed that you have already generated your rails app and have setup github as a repository for your plugin (use their wiki if you haven't, but you should).
These steps apply for either a new or existing app.

Step One: Install the Plugins
-----------------------------
1. There are two plugins to install from github:

script/plugin install git://github.com/lazyatom/engines.git
script/plugin install git://github.com/nerbie69/railstat.git

Step Two: Generate rail_stat
----------------------------
1. After installing the plugin, run the following command:

script/generate rail_stat

Your app has now been populated with the generated db code and your public directory contains images for use with rail_stat code.

2. Set up Rails engines using this line of code in config/environment.rb, just below the rails boot call.

#this line exists
#require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'boot')
#Add right below the above line
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')

Step Three: Database Migration
------------------------------

1. Create the database schema using rake db:migrate

2. Download the IP-to-Country database from http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/ :

   wget http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/downloads/ip-to-country.csv.zip
   unzip ip-to-country.csv.zip
For MAC OS/X Users: instead of getting wget onto your system, just download the file using Safari.

3. Copy ip-to-country.csv into db/ directory

4. Upload the data using ip-to-country.mysql.sql:

   mysql -u _user_ _dbname_ < ip-to-country.mysql.sql

5. Add your web site name to the very bottom of config/environment.rb (assign it to a constant SITE_NAME)
   
   Example:
   SITE_NAME = 'www.mydomain.com'

Notes: Steps 2 - 4 are optional. If you don't want to download ip-to-country database 
       the system will work but the visitor country will not be tracked.
